- i think we need a stack of cursor positions, push on at noFile = yes, pop off at noFile = false

but this is not the actualy cursor (that's normally always at the end of the buffer, end of the logical written data)

what it is, is the start position (the cursor before we wrote that next level down)...so, that we can then slice that out to actually write it...???

A bit confusing bit i think that's correct. hard to know tho. 

Or maybe we just need a stack of noFileBuffers...but it seems a bit redunadant

ultimately i need to think more about this
